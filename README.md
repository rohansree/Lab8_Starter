# Lab 8 - Starter

1. Automated tests fit in this part of the pipeline: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This makes the process more efficient and standardized. If done locally, it will be less standardized, and the test versions might be different per developer. There will also not be documentation on the shared repository. Additionally, testing incrementally instead of at the end allows problems to be more easily isolated and thus fixed.
